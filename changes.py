# The following proposed changes are intended to clarify some procedures or cover other issues discovered while reading the charter.

---

## Quorum & notice for member votes (Articles VII & XVIII)

**Why:** We specify thresholds but not **quorum** or **notice periods**, which can cause legitimacy disputes.

### **Section 7.5 - Quorum & Notice**

**Quorum & Notice.** A quorum for general-membership votes is **25% of Voting-Eligible Members** (unless otherwise specified). Notice of any vote shall be provided at least **14 days** in advance, including the full text of the proposal and voting method.

### **Section 18.1 - Proposed Amendment Notice Period**

Proposed amendments must be circulated **30 days** prior to the vote with exact text and a summary of intent.

---

## Clarify enforcement link between contributions and rights (Articles III, VII, IX)

### **Section 3.5 - Standing & Rights**

**Standing & Rights.** Failure to contribute without an approved hardship exemption/deferral places a member **not in good standing**. While not in good standing, a member’s **voting rights are suspended** and **distributions (if any) are held** in reserve pending cure or formal revocation under Article IX.

---

### **Section 11.6 - LLC ownership** 

The **Trust shall be the sole member** of the Family LLC; the LLC shall be **manager-managed** by the elected Stewards.

> Add after Table of Content, before Article I

### Definitions 

- **Enrolled Member**: An individual recorded in the Trust registry per Article IX and in **good standing**.

- **Voting-Eligible Member**: An Enrolled Member aged **18+** in good standing.
    
- **Eligible Descendant**: A biological or legally adopted descendant of an Enrolled Member who is recorded per Article IX (enrollment may be pending for minors), used for distribution calculations in Article VI.

### Section 8.8 - Fiduciary Accountability

Trustees shall be held personally liable for any breach of fiduciary duty, including but not limited to misappropriation of trust assets, self-dealing, or failure to adhere to the terms of this Charter. In such cases, the Trust reserves the right to pursue legal action for restitution, damages, and removal.  

---

### Section 8.9 - Mandatory Annual Accounting

Trustees shall prepare and distribute an annual financial report to all Voting-Eligible Members, detailing all Trust income, expenses, distributions, and administrative costs. The report must be issued no later than ninety (90) days after the close of each fiscal year. This report shall be made available to all Enrolled Members in accordance with the transparency provisions of Article XIV. Failure to comply shall constitute grounds for removal under Section 8.7.

**Account Statement Transparency**

Trustees shall ensure that monthly statements from all Trust accounts—including all bank accounts and investment accounts—are made available promptly to all Enrolled Members. This ongoing transparency allows members to monitor Trust activity closely and serves as an additional check against misconduct or unauthorized transactions.

---

### Section 8.10 - Oversight and Enforcement

Any Voting-Eligible Member may petition for an independent audit or initiate legal proceedings in the event of suspected Trustee misconduct. If Trustees are found to have violated their duties, they shall be subject to civil liability, removal from office, and disqualification from future service as a Trustee.

---

### Section 8.11 - Transaction Transparency and Execution Protocol

**Advance Notification:** All financial transactions initiated by the Trustees on behalf of the Trust shall trigger an automated Trust-wide alert, sent via email to all registered members. The alert shall include:

 1. A detailed description of the proposed transaction;  

 2. The names of the initiating Trustee(s);  

 3. The scheduled execution date and time (if known);  

 4. Instructions for submitting objections or concerns.

**Recommended Review Period:** Trustees shall make every reasonable effort to allow a seventy-two (72) hour period for member review before executing non-urgent transactions.

**Objection Protocol:** If objections are received before execution, the Trustees shall pause the transaction when possible and refer the matter to the full membership for vote or review as outlined in **Article VII, Section 7.2*

**Recordkeeping:** All alerts and objections shall be archived and made available for audit and review.

---

### **Section 6.5 – Investment Income and Principal Protection**

1. All new member contributions shall be initially deposited into the Trust’s designated bank account.
    
2. Contributions shall be transferred to the Trust’s investment account on a regular schedule, no less frequently than monthly, to enable timely investment of funds.
    
3. The Trustees shall oversee the timing and amounts of transfers to align with the Trust’s investment strategy and cash flow needs.
