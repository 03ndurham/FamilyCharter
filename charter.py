### Section 3.1 – Contribution Requirements

- All eligible members shall contribute **$10 USD per month**, commencing at age **21** and continuing until age **65**.
    
    - Members may choose to make the contributions monthly or as a single annual payment of **$120**.
        
    - Members may contribute more than the required amount; however, **no additional rights, privileges, distributions, voting power, governance authority, or preferential treatment** shall be granted to the contributor or their descendants as a result of such excess contributions. All contributions—whether at, above, or below the required amount—shall be treated equally for purposes of benefits, governance, and participation in Trust affairs.
        
- Contributions are **symbolic and fixed**; they shall not be adjusted for inflation or Trust growth.
    
- **Equal Standing Clause (Immutable):** All members, regardless of the amount they contribute beyond the required sum, shall remain equal in all rights, privileges, distributions, governance participation, and access to Trust resources. No excess contribution shall create or imply any preferential treatment, advantage, or authority for the contributor or for any of their descendants, now or in the future. This clause is an **immutable provision** under Article XVIII and cannot be altered without unanimous consent to dissolve this Charter.

- Once a Contribution is made, the member who makes it forfeits any claim to that contribution. It is belongs exclusively to the Trust.

### Section 3.2 – Opt-Out Provision

- Any eligible member may **opt out** of participation.
    
- Opting Out forfeits any and all benefits, including, but not limited to receiving distributions, voting rights, access to LLC owned properties. Individuals who **Opt-Out** are not eligible for a refund of any paid contributions.
    

### Section 3.3 – Founding Members

- Founding Members shall begin contributing upon inception and are required to contribute for a **minimum of 10 years**, even if exceeding age 65.
    
### Section 3.4 – Financial Hardship Exemptions

1. **Temporary Contribution Relief**
    
    - Trustees may, by simple majority vote, approve a **temporary waiver or reduction** of the $10 monthly contribution for any enrolled member experiencing verified financial hardship.
        
    - Hardship may include but is not limited to: job loss, disability, major medical expenses, or other significant life events.
        
    - Relief may last for up to **12 months**, renewable upon review.
        
2. **Deferred Contributions**
    
    - Trustees may, instead of waiving, allow contributions to be **deferred and repaid** over time once the member is financially able. Terms may be tailored based on the situation.
        
3. **Confidentiality and Dignity**
    
    - All hardship-related trustee votes, exemptions, and outcomes shall be recorded and visible to enrolled members as part of standard Trust archives. Personal details provided by the applicant shall be limited in those records to protect individual dignity. Trustees shall use discretion in how much personal context is included in the public log.
        
4. **Recordkeeping**
    
    - All exemptions and deferrals shall be **documented** for transparency and reviewed annually for renewal or adjustment.
        

> _This provision affirms that while shared responsibility is expected, compassion and flexibility shall guide its application._

### Section 3.5 - Standing & Rights

Failure to contribute without an approved hardship exemption/deferral places a member **not in good standing**. While not in good standing, a member’s **voting rights are suspended** and **distributions** are forfeit (reinvested) until the member is either back in good standing, a harship exemption/deferral is in place, or the member is removed in accordance with Article IX.

---

## **Article VII – Voting Rights and Governance**

### Section 7.1 – Voting Eligibility

- Full voting rights commence at **age 18** for enrolled members.
    

### Section 7.2 – Voting Scope

- Voting may determine:

    - Annual charitable recipient

- A **simple majority** of voting members is sufficient to remove a Steward.
    
- A **two-thirds (66%) majority** is required to remove a Trustee, due to the higher level of fiduciary responsibility.

---

## **Article VIII – Trustee Governance**

### Section 8.1 – Trustee Composition

- The Trust shall maintain **seven (7)** Trustees.

 - As the Family grows, so should the number of Trustees. It is expected that future amendments will adjust this number upward. The number of Trustees should always remain odd to prevent ties that require a simple majority of Trustees.


### Section 8.2 – Eligibility

- Trustees must:
    
    - Be at least **30 years old**
        
    - Have contributed for **five (5) consecutive years**
      
Provisional Trustees are exempt from the standard eligibility requirements outlined in Article VIII, Section 8.2, during the initial implementation period.

**Transitional Eligibility Exception**:  
For the **first official Trustee election only**, any enrolled member aged **30 or older** who has made at least **twelve (12) consecutive months** of contributions shall be deemed eligible to run for Trustee, even if they have not yet met the five (5) year contribution requirement. This exception shall apply **only once**, for the initial election cycle, and shall not modify eligibility requirements for subsequent election. This allows for continuity of leadership during the Trust’s early years.


### Section 8.3 – Election and Term

1. **Term Duration and Transition**  
    Each Trustee shall serve a term of **ten and a half (10.5) years**, beginning on **October 1** of the election year.
    
    - The **first six (6) months** of the term shall function as an **onboarding period**, during which the incoming Trustee works alongside their predecessor to receive training, transfer access and documentation, and become familiar with ongoing operations such as distributions, taxes, votes, and LLC activities.
        
    - After the onboarding period, the Trustee assumes full responsibilities for the remaining ten (10) years of the term.
        
2. **Consecutive Terms Prohibited**  
    No individual may serve **two consecutive Trustee terms**. A former Trustee may run for re-election only after sitting out a full 10.5-year term.
    
3. **Staggered Elections Encouraged**  
    Elections should be scheduled, when possible, to **stagger Trustee turnover**, ensuring that no more than 50% of seats are up for election in any given cycle. This preserves institutional knowledge and continuity.
    
4. **Mid-Term Resignations or Removal**  
    If a Trustee resigns or is removed mid-term, the remaining Trustees may appoint a **temporary replacement** by majority vote to serve until the next regularly scheduled election.
    

### Section 8.4 – Trustee Election Voting Method

1. **Voting System**  
    Trustee elections shall be conducted using a **ranked-choice voting system** designed to reflect voter consensus and minimize polarization.
    
2. **Balloting Process**
    
    - Each eligible voting member may rank as many candidates as they choose in order of preference.
        
    - Votes shall be tabulated in rounds:
        
        - In each round, the candidate(s) with the fewest votes are eliminated.
            
        - Ballots for eliminated candidates are redistributed to the next preferred ranked choice still in contention.
            
        - This continues until the number of remaining candidates equals the number of open seats.
            
3. **Election Frequency and Timing**  
    Trustee elections occur **once every ten (10) years**, unless:
    
    - A Trustee is removed,
        
    - A mid-term vacancy arises (see 8.3.4), or
        
    - The number of seated Trustees drops below the required minimum (five).

	Elections are scheduled at **10-year intervals** to allow a **six-month onboarding overlap** before the new term begins on October 1.
        
4. **Tie Resolution**  
    If a tie affects the final outcome, the decision shall be made by:
    
    - A majority vote of current Trustees
	    - If the Trustee vote results in a tie, the decision shall be resolved by the flip of a coin, witnessed by at least three enrolled members.
        
5. **Transparency and Recordkeeping**  
    All votes shall be recorded and archived in accordance with **Article XIV – Archives and Transparency**. Election results, vote counts, and ranked elimination rounds shall be made available to all enrolled members.


### Section 8.5 - Fiduciary Accountability

Trustees shall be held personally liable for any breach of fiduciary duty, including but not limited to misappropriation of trust assets, self-dealing, or failure to adhere to the terms of this Charter. In such cases, the Trust reserves the right to pursue legal action for restitution, damages, and removal.  


### Section 8.6 - Mandatory Annual Accounting

Trustees shall prepare and publish an annual financial report, detailing all Trust income, expenses, distributions, and administrative costs.The report must be issued no later than January 31 in accordance with the transparency provisions of Article XIV. Failure to comply shall constitute grounds for removal under Section 7.4.

**Account Statement Transparency**

Trustees shall ensure that monthly statements from all Trust accounts—including all bank accounts and investment accounts—are published promptly to all Enrolled Members. This ongoing transparency allows members to monitor Trust activity closely and serves as an additional check against misconduct or unauthorized transactions.


### Section 8.7 - Oversight and Enforcement

Any Voting-Eligible Member may petition for an independent audit or initiate legal proceedings in the event of suspected Trustee misconduct. If Trustees are found to have violated their duties, they shall be subject to civil liability, removal from office, and disqualification from future service as a Trustee.


### Section 8.8 - Transaction Transparency and Execution Protocol

> This Section is subject to the limitations of the investment platform used by the Trust.

**Advance Notification:** Withdrawal, Sales, and Transfers Out of the Investment Account initiated by the Trustees on behalf of the Trust shall trigger an automated Trust-wide alert, sent via email to all registered members. The alert shall include:

 1. A detailed description of the proposed transaction;  

 2. The names of the initiating Trustee(s);  

 3. The scheduled execution date and time (if known);  

 4. Instructions for submitting objections or concerns.

**Recommended Review Period:** Trustees shall make every reasonable effort to allow a seventy-two (72) hour period for member review before executing non-urgent transactions.

**Objection Protocol:** If objections are received before execution, the Trustees shall pause the transaction when possible and refer the matter to the full membership for vote or review as outlined in **Article VII, Section 7.2*

**Recordkeeping:** All alerts and objections shall be archived and made available for audit and review.

### Section 9.4 – Multi-Generational Opt-In Procedure

1. Any enrolled member may submit a petition to the Trustee Board requesting review of the individual's eligibility for enrollment.
2. A **simple majority vote** of Trustees is required to advance the petition to a general vote of the voting-eligible members.

Upon approval:
- The new member shall begin contributions in accordance with **Article III**.

- The ramp-up shall continue until the member reaches **100% of their entitled distribution in the 11th year** of enrollment.

1. **Access to Family LLC Properties**: The surviving spouse shall retain access to all Family LLC properties and events, subject to standard usage and stewardship policies.

2. **Distributions**: The surviving spouse shall receive half the annual distributions that the deceased member would have been entitled to, for a period of **five (5) years**.

3. **Eligibility for Extension**: After the initial **five (5) year** period, access and distribution eligibility may be extended on a case-by-case basis by a **two-thirds (66%) majority vote** of the Trustees.

> *This provision honors the role of surviving spouses in the family while maintaining the integrity of lineage-based benefits.*


---

## **Appendices**

### Appendix A: Letter to Future Generations

Written by Nathan Durham, July 25, 2025

I don’t know when you’re reading this — it could be a few years from now, or a hundred. But whenever it is, you carry the legacy (if not the name) and the responsibility that comes with being part of this family. You’re part of something bigger now. And I want to tell you why this Trust exists.

My grandparents, Edward and Sandra Cruikshank, didn’t have much. They were good people who worked hard and passed down more values than money. My parents’ generation carried that same grit and humility. I grew up with a little more — not everything, but enough to understand just how much of a difference a little security can make.

I started thinking seriously about all this while planning for my own retirement. As I looked at how my 401(k) would grow over the next few decades, I started wondering: _what if the whole family had something like this?_  
Something bigger than one person. Something built to last.

This Trust wasn’t born from wealth. It came from a simple idea — that _small things, done consistently over time, can change everything._ Ten dollars a month doesn’t sound like much — and depending on when you’re reading this, it might be almost nothing. But left alone to grow, and managed with care, it can become something powerful. Something that shapes lives.

And sure, maybe this fund will grow large someday. But that’s not the point. Wealth isn’t the real inheritance here. The real gift is the responsibility — to care for one another, to make wise decisions, and to pass along something even better than what we started with.

Because this isn’t just a pool of money. It’s a tool.  
A way to stay connected as a family, even as we grow and spread across the world.  
A way to help future generations build lives with greater freedom and purpose — not just financially, but in every way that matters.  
A way to make sure no one is left behind when life takes a hard turn — through job loss, medical emergencies, or unexpected disasters.  
A way to give back, through acts of kindness, generosity, and charity.

I hope you still gather for reunions. I hope you still get together for poker night. In my time, those games were never really about money. They were about being together — telling stories and jokes, laughing so hard you couldn’t breathe, holding your sides because it actually hurt to laugh that much. That’s the spirit I hope lives on. Those memories are priceless. That’s what makes this the best family to belong to.

Helping build this Trust has been one of the greatest honors of my life. I don’t need credit or praise — I just want to see us keep moving forward, together. This isn’t my gift to the family. This is _our_ gift to the future. 

I want to thank the founding members who helped make this possible: Carole Preston, Heather Hernandez, Lucy Livermore, Harry Cruikshank, William Cruikshank, Benjamin Livermore, Tricia Cruikshank, Michael Cruikshank, Josh Wood, John Wood, and Morgan Cruikshank. Without their support, wisdom, and faith in the long view, none of this would exist.

So take care of it. Take care of each other.  
And never underestimate the power of small things done with love and patience.

With all my heart,  
**Nathan Durham**
